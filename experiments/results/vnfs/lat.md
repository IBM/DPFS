# Statfs
Half of the time:
Host statfs latency = 82usec
NFS statfs latency = 48usec
Host<>DPU overhead = 34usec

But then the other half:
Host statfs latency = 113usec
NFS statfs latency = 77usec
Host<>DPU overhead = 36usec

Only gives good numbers half of the time. Something weird happening on DPU
